## Technical Details and Inspiration

This project was inspired by our love for city and a desire to make meal planning and recipe discovery more enjoyable. Emmanuel collaborated with Sentayenu Demissie, a backend developer, to bring this project to life. While primarily a frontend developer, Emmy also took on some backend work to ensure the project was complete and functional.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges was integrating the Spoonacular API and ensuring smooth interaction between the frontend and backend. We used Flask for the backend and jQuery along with the fetch API for the frontend to achieve seamless functionality.

### Future Improvements

- Implementing user authentication and profile management.
- Adding more advanced meal planning features.
- Enhancing the user interface for a more interactive experience.
